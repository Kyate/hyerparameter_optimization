Finds the global maxima of a costly function in a parallelized setting. Runs
optimizer.py in parallel with with several worker nodes that evaluates the costly
function in batch. 

Run as: mpiexec -np 4 python parallel_optimizer.py
where 4 is the number of available processes

Framework: 
Master -- handles the Optimizer object (which takes prior data,
interpolates based on a neural network-linear regression model, and selects the
next set of points to query). Tells worker nodes which points to query.

Worker -- compute the costly function. Returns function evaluation.

Trainer -- in charge of handling the neural network training.
